# Digital-logic-minimization-using-the-Espresso-algorithm
Espresso is a pseudo-algorithm which helps us reduce the redundancy in our digital logic containing a high number of variables. It involves 3 steps namely, expand irredundant and reduce, which are performed in a decided sequence until a further change in the output is not measured.
Here is the link of the slides briefly explaining all the 3 steps - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iUTXgSCMHJry0lWcfrAti5PiQktXovRBdxCcRtQXiGw/edit#slide=id.g104416eb078_0_5
